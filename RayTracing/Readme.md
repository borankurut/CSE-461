# Ray Tracer

This is a simple ray tracer I created for a homework project. It generates a PPM image of a scene based on XML scene files.

Sample outputs:
![scene_cat](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b05f1200-a7ab-4567-9237-12356c330740)
![scene_chest](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/349db003-7266-4810-a48c-e73b6dac1091)
![scene_spheres](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ea54a0eb-b10b-41e6-aacd-6bf1f5abb9c7)
